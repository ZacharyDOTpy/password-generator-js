# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

In this challenge I used for loops to select random characters from a specific character set selected by the user via prompts. The use must select a password length between 8 - 128 characters and is then prompted on what character types they would like in their password. I used an alert to prompt the user if they made a selection outside of the parameters. For each prompt I used if statements to concatinate their selections into the possible character pool for their randomly generated password.
